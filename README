this is my entry into the http://sunlightlabs.com/contest/

my entry email sent to them.

I've been working with MASHUP APIs for a number of years now and ran across your contest by accident looking for data to integrate into my mashup @mashupkeyword.com. Before I found your site I had support for youtube, flickr, backtype, friendfeed, google, yahoo, eventful already and the data you all provided fits extremely well.

Using CakePHP as the framework. Originally I had used the Zend Framework the MVC pattern  was cumbersome so I ported it to CakePHP. (should have re-read that message) 
The software is a wrapper named MASHUP::Keyword I developed to make it easy to fetch data about a word.

I've already started to integrate that data into the mashup.  apidump.csv.gz and lobbyist data provided here:

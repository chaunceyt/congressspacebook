# The rules below basically say that if the file exists in the tree, just
# serve it; otherwise, go to index.php. This is more future-proof for your
# site, because if you start adding more and more content types, you don't
# need to alter the .htaccess to accomodate them.
# This is an important concept for the Front Controller Pattern which the
# ZF MVC makes use of.
